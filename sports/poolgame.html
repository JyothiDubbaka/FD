        <p>Pool is a classification of cue sports played on a table with six 
            pockets along the rails, into which balls are deposited.[1][2] Each 
            specific pool game has its own name; some of the better-known include 
            eight-ball, blackball, nine-ball, ten-ball, seven-ball, straight pool,
             one-pocket, and bank pool. Eight-ball is the most frequently played 
             discipline of pool, and is often thought of as synonymous with "pool".
