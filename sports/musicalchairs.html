        <p>Musical chairs is a game of elimination involving players, chairs, and 
            music, with one fewer chair than players. When the music stops 
            whichever player fails to sit on a chair is eliminated, with a chair 
            then being removed and the process repeated until only one player 
            remains.</p>
