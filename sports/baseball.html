        <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine 
            players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs 
            over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning 
            when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball 
            that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit 
            with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is 
            to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's 
            players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance 
            counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 
            The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) 
            is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' 
            advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally 
            advances around the bases in order and touches home plate 
            (the place where the player started as a batter).</p>
