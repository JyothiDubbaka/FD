        <p>Pachisi was created in India in the sixth century CE. The earliest 
            evidence of this game's evolution in India is the depiction of boards 
            on the caves of Ellora. The original version is also described in the 
            Indian epic Mahabharata in which Shakuni uses cursed dice to beat the 
            Pandavas, and at last after losing everything, Yudhisthira puts his 
            wife Draupadi on stake and loses her, too. The Pandavas get all 
            their belongings back, though, after Draupadi vows to curse the whole 
            Kuru lineage, but stops at the intervention of Gandhari, and seeing 
            an opportunity to still Draupadi's anger, Kuru king Dhritarashtra 
            promises to give back to the Pandavas all that they had lost in the 
            game.</p>
