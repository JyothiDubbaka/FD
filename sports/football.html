        <p>Football (also known as association football or soccer) is a team 
            sport played between two teams of 11 players each. It is widely 
            considered to be the most popular sport in the world. A ball game, 
            it is played on a rectangular grass field, or occasionally 
            an artificial turf, with a goal at each end of the field. 
            The object of the game is to score by manoeuvring the ball into 
            the opposing goal; only the goalkeepers may use their hands or 
            arms to propel the ball in general play. The team that scores 
            the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied 
            at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes
            into extended time, depending on the format of the competition.</p>
