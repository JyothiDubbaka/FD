        <p>chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two 
            opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of 
            contrasting colours, commonly white and black. White moves first, 
            after which the players alternate turns in accordance with fixed 
            rules, each player attempting to force the opponent’s principal 
            piece, the King, into checkmate—a position where it is unable to 
            avoid capture.</p>
